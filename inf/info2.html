        <h4 id="item-1"> Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? </h4>
        <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
            transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
            through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
            spread?” 
             </p>
        <h5 id="item-1-1"> Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? </h5>
        <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
            expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
            from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
            people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
            particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
            possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
            a mild cough and does not feel ill.  </p>
        <h5 id="item-1-2"> Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease? </h5>
        <p> The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
            appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
            be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a 
            main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
            COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
            this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
            after using the bathroom and before eating. </p>
        <h4 id="item-2">Protection measures for everyone 
        </h4>
        <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
            available on the national,state and local public health authority. Many
            countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several
            have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
            have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the
            situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
            You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions:
            • Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
            Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
            alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
            • Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
            anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
            Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
            droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
            are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
            COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
            • Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
            Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
            Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
            nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
            can make you sick.
            • Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
            respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
            with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then 
            dispose of the used tissue immediately. 
            </p>
