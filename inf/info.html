        <h4 id="item-1"> corona virus</h4>
        <p>Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
            in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
            to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
            severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
            and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
            discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. </p>
        <h5 id="item-1-1"> COVID-19</h5>
        <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
            discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
            before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. </p>
        <h5 id="item-1-2"> symptoms of COVID-19</h5>
        <p> The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
            dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
            congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
            usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
            don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
            (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
            treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
            becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
            and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
            heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
            People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
            attention. </p>
        <h4 id="item-2">How does COVID-19 spread
        </h4>
        <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
            disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
            the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
            coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
            around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
            these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
            People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
            person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
            why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
            person who is sick.
